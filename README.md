# TensorFlow_ImageClassification

## Overview

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The trained model can be used to classify images into one of ten different classes.

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- OS

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy os
```
## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using the instructions provided in the Installation section.
Run the Python scripts to train the model and make predictions.
Dataset
The code uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The details of the architecture can be found in the code.
